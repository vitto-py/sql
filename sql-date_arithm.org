* The Difference between 2 dates
The difference between 2 dates must have an unit,
it can be days, months, years, etc but it must have a
unit

** Days
#+begin_src sql
SELECT
-- in postgreSQL the default is days
ward_hd - allen_hd as days

-- SQL server
-- datediff(day,allen_hd,ward_hd)
FROM (
  -- ward's date
  SELECT hiredate AS ward_hd
  FROM emp
  WHERE ename = 'WARD'
) x,
(
  -- allen's date
  SELECT hiredate AS allen_hd
  FROM emp
  WHERE ename = 'ALLEN'
) y;

#+end_src
Result
| days |
|------|
|    2 |

** Months and years
In SQL Server only is needed to change the unit parameter
#+begin_src sql
-- FROM
datediff(day,allen_hd,ward_hd)
-- TO for months
datediff(month,allen_hd,ward_hd)
-- OR for years
datediff(year,allen_hd,ward_hd)
#+end_src

Full example
#+begin_src sql
SELECT
  datediff(month, min_hd, max_hd) AS months_diff,
  datediff(year, min_hd, max_hd) AS years_diff
FROM (
  SELECT
    min(hiredate) AS min_hd,
    max(hiredate) AS max_hd
  FROM emp
) x;

#+end_src

But in postgreSQL is not so easy

#+begin_src sql
SELECT
  mnth,
  mnth / 12 AS mnth_divided_by_12
FROM (
  SELECT
    --  multiply the difference in years between MIN_HD and MAX_HD by 12
    -- this yields the MAIN diff (el entero)
    (
      EXTRACT(YEAR FROM max_hd) - EXTRACT(YEAR FROM min_hd)
    ) * 12
    -- now the decimals (the months that do not add to a year)
    +
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM max_hd) - EXTRACT(MONTH FROM min_hd) AS mnth
  FROM (
    SELECT
      MIN(hiredate) AS min_hd,
      MAX(hiredate) AS max_hd
    FROM emp
  ) x
) y;

#+end_src
*** Explanation
lets start from the basics, the dates
#+begin_src sql
select
  min(hiredate) as min_hd,
  max(hiredate) as max_hd
from
  emp
#+end_src

| MIN_HD      | MAX_HD      |
|-------------+-------------|
| 17-DEC-1980 | 12-JAN-1983 |

This are the two dates, they are 25 months apart,
approximately 2 years

PostgreSQL has the function EXTRACT which will help us
to isolate the MONTHS and the YEARS. we need to combine
both information to get the difference

#+begin_src sql
-- BOTH parts isolated
SELECT
	-- only years 1983 - 1980 = 3 years
    (EXTRACT(YEAR FROM max_hd) - EXTRACT(YEAR FROM min_hd)) years,
    -- only months DEZ to JAN = -11 months
	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM max_hd) - EXTRACT(MONTH FROM min_hd) AS months
  FROM (
    SELECT
      MIN(hiredate) AS min_hd,
      MAX(hiredate) AS max_hd
    FROM emp
  ) x
#+end_src
Result
| years | months |
|-------+--------|
|     3 |    -11 |

To get the correct answer, both information must be related
1. Convert years to months
2. Calculate the difference

#+begin_src sql
-- BOTH parts isolated
SELECT
	-- only years 1983 - 1980 = 3 years
    (EXTRACT(YEAR FROM max_hd) - EXTRACT(YEAR FROM min_hd)) * 12 -
    -- only months DEZ to JAN = -11 months
	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM max_hd) - EXTRACT(MONTH FROM min_hd) AS months
  FROM (
    SELECT
      MIN(hiredate) AS min_hd,
      MAX(hiredate) AS max_hd
    FROM emp
  ) x
#+end_src
Results
| months |
|--------|
|     25 |

To calculate the years just divide by 12

*** Simplify formula
| MAX_YR | MIN_YR | MAX_MON | MIN_MON |
|--------+--------+---------+---------|
|   1983 |   1980 |       1 |      12 |
Formula
-  (1983 − 1980) × 12 + (1 − 12) = 25

* Seconds, Minutes, or Hours Between Two Dates
In SQL server this is easy, the DATEDIFF() function has
a fourth argument, which allows you to cast DAYs to other
units as hours, minutes, seconds

#+begin_src sql
select
    datediff(day, allen_hd, ward_hd, hour) as hr,
    datediff(day, allen_hd, ward_hd, minute) as min,
    datediff(day, allen_hd, ward_hd, second) as sec
from (
    select
        max(case when ename = 'WARD' then hiredate end) as ward_hd,
        max(case when ename = 'ALLEN' then hiredate end) as allen_hd
    from emp
) x;

#+end_src

Again, in postgreSQL is not so easy
*** PostgreSQL
Use subtraction to return the number of days between ALLEN_HD and WARD_ HD.
Then multiply to find each unit of time:
#+begin_src sql
SELECT ename, hiredate
FROM emp
WHERE ename IN ('ALLEN', 'WARD');
#+end_src
| ename |   hiredate |
|-------+------------|
| ALLEN | 2006-02-20 |
| WARD  | 2006-02-22 |
Calculate the difference between this 2 dates
#+begin_src sql
select dy * 24 as hr, dy * 24 * 60 as min, dy * 24 * 60 * 60 as sec
from (
    select
	    -- by default the unit is DAY
        (max(case when ename = 'WARD' then hiredate end) -
         max(case when ename = 'ALLEN' then hiredate end)) as dy
    from emp
) x;

#+end_src
| hr  | min  | sec    |
|-----|------|--------|
| 48  | 2880 | 172800 |
